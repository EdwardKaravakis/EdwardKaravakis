My name is Edward Karavakis and I'm a Senior Applications Engineer at [Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL)](https://bnl.gov) stationed at [CERN, the European Organisation for Nuclear Research](https://home.cern) in Geneva, Switzerland. 

I am a member of the [Nuclear and Particle Physics Software (NPPS) Group](https://npps.bnl.gov/). The group in BNL's [Physics Department](https://www.bnl.gov/physics/) participates in a wide range of experiments across BNL's nuclear and particle physics programs. NPPS provides software and expertise across many technical areas, with a particular emphasis on common software solutions. I am a member of the [Production and Distributed Analysis (PanDA)](https://panda-wms.readthedocs.io/) workload management project's core development team and a contributor to [ATLAS](https://atlas.cern) and [Vera C. Rubin](https://www.lsst.org/) PanDA development & operations.
